Included here are completed Labs 1-9 and tutorial/practice code in TUT1-6.

[**Lab 0**](https://github.com/pietrea2/C-Programming---UofT-1st-Year/tree/main/Lab%200)
+ Basic printf statements of special characters

[**Lab 1**](https://github.com/pietrea2/C-Programming---UofT-1st-Year/tree/main/Lab%201)
+ **Computing Standard Deviation**
+ C input/output and math computation

[**Lab 2**](https://github.com/pietrea2/C-Programming---UofT-1st-Year/tree/main/Lab%202)
+ **Electrical Resistor Calculator**
  + **Input**: 4 colours of the bands on the resistor
  + **Output**: Total resistance (Ohms) + tolerance (Ohms)
+ There are 2 versions of this project:
  + Using arrays to store the colours of the resistor bands
  + _Not_ using arrays
