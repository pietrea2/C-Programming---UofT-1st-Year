# Lab 2: Electrical Resistor Calculator

To determine the resistance value of an electrical resistor, you read the colour bands and follow the chart below.

This program prompts the user to input the **1st, 2nd, multiplier and tolerance band.**

The total resistive value is finally calculated and shown to the user.

+ **Input:** 4 colours of the bands on the resistor
+ **Output:** Total resistance (Ohms) + tolerance (% Ohms)

There are 2 versions of this project:
+ Using arrays to store the colours of the resistor bands
+ Not using arrays
